Simple image viewer made with Odin and SDL3

It was made for learning the language and the sdl api,
Configuration via the config.json

the "ui" was 100% based on the [NSXIV](https://github.com/nsxiv/nsxiv) project

Build yourself:

Just run the commands in the build_commands.txt

Dependencies for building it yourself:
[Odin Language](https://odin-lang.org/)
[SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
SDL3 Image
[Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master), i had to implement the SDL 3 Renderer bindings myself for Windows and Linux from C++, 
i might upload it once i figure out how, i cant know if it works on Macos

On windoows you need to have the sdl3 dlls in either in the project root
or in the System32 folder.
